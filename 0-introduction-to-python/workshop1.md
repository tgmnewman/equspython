# 1.  Workshop 1 - Command Line, Git and Python, Getting started

## 1.1 Basic command line usage

Opening a terminal. Navigating through directories. Basic actions: executing files, creating and deleting files and directories, copying and moving.

An operating system is a series of excuses and abstractions that allow us to use text fields to control hardware operations. These text fields can be directly entered using a terminal emulator. (the real terminal is likely being used by your operating system to render the graphical environment that you're using and provides all the modern niceties of mouse support, windowed environments and anything that isn't strictly text based).

| Operating System        | Getting to your terminal emulator  |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Windows      | Window + r gives you a "run" window. Into this enter either cmd.exe or powershell.exe |
| Linux      | Depends on your choice of window manager, common short cuts are Ctrl + Alt + T, but it could be just about anything. |
| Mac | Command + Spacebar and type in "terminal" |

You can replace the windows terminal emulator with Bash if you want, this can either be done by installing Git Bash, or by running Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Whatever you do, it's highly recommended to set a key binding to open your terminal emulator.

These terminals take commands in the form of text and return responses in the form of text (generally ASCII encoded). This common format allows us to pass text not only to commands, but take the output of one command as the input to another. 

| Command        | Unix (Linux or Mac) | Windows |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| List Directory Contents |  `ls` | `dir` (ls will work on powershell) |
| Change Directory   |  `cd <path>` | `cd <path>` |
| Copy a file | `cp <source> <destination>` | `cp <source> <destination>` |
| Move a file | `mv <source> <destination>` | `mv <source> <destination>` |
| Make a directory | `mkdir <path to new directory>` | `mkdir <path to new directory>` | 
| List processes and pids| `ps au` (or `top` or `htop`)| `tasklist` |
| Killing a process| `kill <pid>` | `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` |
| Shutdown | `shutdown now` | `poweroff -s -t 0` |
| Restart | `restart now` | `poweroff -r -t 0` |
| Execute a file | `<command to run file> <path to file>` | `<command to run file> <path to file>` |
| Executing a Python file | `python <path to file>` | `python <path to file>` |

When you need to specify a path as an argument this is a relative path from the current directory. Unix paths must use the forward-slash key (as backslash is reserved to escape certain characters) while windows originally used backslashed paths and now uses both.

There are a few useful short-cuts that are almost essential 

| Command        |  Character | Example
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Auto complete | tab | Just about anything really |
| Previous command | Up arrow key | |
| Absolute Path |  `/` or `C:\` | `cd /home/` or `cd C:\` |
| Up a directory   |  `..` | `cd ..` |
| Home Directory | `~` | `cd ~/Documents` |
| Previous command | `!!`| `sudo !!` |
| Interrupt a process | Ctrl + C| |
| EOF | Ctrl + D | |

It's worth noting that the tab key will auto complete paths (and some commands), making this quite a bit faster than typing everything out manually. Depending on how your shell is configured, pressing tab twice may also list possible completions if you aren't sure what you were looking for.

The terminal is an incredibly useful tool that we will be using throughout the workshop.

## *[Problem 5-10 minutes] - Command Line Blues*

Get used to the command line:

- Open up a terminal and try to navigate from your current position to the topmost (root) directory and then back to your own Documents folder.
- Once you've managed this, try to find the process ID of your terminal emulator and get it to terminate its own process. 
- Re-open your terminal and navigate to `__equs__.python`, in here make a new directory titled 'problems'. Keep your code from today in here. (in later weeks we'll be converting this to a git repository).

As ever, if you are stuck or unsure about what to do, ask sooner rather than later.


## 1.2 Hello Version Control (Git)

Git is version control software that allows you to checkout and
collaborate with software projects. It is designed to track updates to
software projects through the use of `commit`s versions. Users can
construct checkout and have their own version of a software project by
`clone`ing the software repositoru.

We will be introducing you to git by making this very repository
a git repository. You will be able to clone your own version and
`push` to your own account or just simply hold it on your own system.

## 1.2.1 Checkout the tutorial

You can checkout the tutorial by cloning the following repository
`https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python`. You will need to
use the `clone` subcommand with git like so.

```
git clone https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python
```

If this command is not working, it is likely you have encountered an
issue with your platform's setup with git.




## 1.2.2 Constructing a repository

If you haven't already, please go to `github.com` and sign up for a github
account. This account allows you to store your software projects remotely
on github. This can enable collaborate and for this particular workshop,
   can be used to demonstrate and display your knowledge.

After creating an account, you can visit `https://github.com/equs-python/__equs__.Python` and `fork` the repository. This will allow you to have
your own snapshot of the repository as part of your own account.

## 1.3 Hello Python!

Python is a high-level scripting language. It's quite flexible and has a well supported package library that allows it to do everything from scientific computing to running a twitter bot. The ease of use of Python does come at something of a trade-off in performance, however in most cases the faster code development will more than offset the extra time required to run the code

For historical reasons currently Python 2 and 3 exist as slightly different languages, Python 2 support will end in less than a year and so it's not particularly worth going into the differences between the two except to suggest using Python 3. 

Another key point is that Python is named after 'Monty Python', hence it is somewhat obligatory that any tutorial in the language include slightly too many references to 1970s British comedy. It is noted in advance that including jokes is a generally poor design choice for any real code.

### 1.3.1 Command line Interpreter

Open up the python command line interpreter (CLI) with the `python` command from your terminal emulator. As Python is an interpreted language, each line is read and executed in order. Thanks to this feature, we can use a Python terminal and simply give it Python code to execute.

Obviously, the first thing we do in any language is print the string "Hello World", I have it on good authority that the exclamation mark at the end of this string is strictly optional.

```python
>>> print("Hello World")
```

We can also treat it as a basic calculator

```python
>>> 1 + 2
3
```

The up arrow key will iterate through previous commands, which is faster than typing them out.

The regular maths operations are present (`+-/*`), as are powers: `**` and modulus `%`.

The up arrow key will iterate through previous commands, which is faster than typing them out.

### *[Problem - 2 Minutes] - Draw a box*

Use multiple print statements to output a box to the terminal. Your program should output the following
onto the terminal.

```
+=======+
|       |
|       |
|       |
+=======+
```

### 1.3.3 Literals and Variables

In the above examples `1` is a literal value, in theory I cannot change what `1` is, for example the following operation is illegal: 
```python
1 = 2
```
The operations are baked into the instructions that are part of the program and for the most part cannot be modified.
Conversely I can define regions of memory that may hold a variable value. These regions of memory are labelled with some name and are termed variables. Variables may be assigned a value using the assignment operator `=`.

```python
variable = 2
```

Unlike some other languages, variables in Python are untyped, the interpreter decides what the best type for the variable based on the data provided. This also implies that literals carry their own type which is then assumed by the variable.

```python
an_int = 2
a_float = 2.2
a_string = 'abc'
another_string = "def"
more_strings = """hijk"""
and_the_other_way = '''lm"no'''
a_complex_number = 1j
a_boolean = True
a_none_type_object = None
a_bytes_object = b"001010"
``` 

The assignment operator may also be used to assign the value of one variable to another:

```python
x = 5
y = x
```

We now have two different regions of memory labelled `x` and `y` each containing the same data.

You can check the type of a variable using the `type()` function, for example:

```python
>>> type(an_int)
int
```

If you don't know what a function does you can use the `help()` function to read the documentation for the function, so for instance, you should be able to call

```python
help(type)
```

## *[Problem - 5 minutes] - Operational* 

Some very basic Python:

 - Initialise a variable to some negative or complex number.
 - Figure out how to take the absolute value of your variable. The `help` function will be useful here. There may be more than one way to do this.
 - What is the type of the help function?
 - What is the type of the type function?

We've implicitly started using a number of operators here. What is the behaviour of each of the following operators and what types are they defined over? Some of these operators may exhibit different behaviour for different types. The `bin` function is defined over some types and may assist in decyphering some of these operators.

 - `=`
 - `+`
 - `-`
 - `%`
 - `/`
 - `*`
 - `|`
 - `&`
 - `^`
 - `~`

 Or some digraphs:

 - `==`
 - `//`
 - `<<`
 - `>>`
 - `**`

Lastly some compound operators:

 - `+=`
 - `**=`
 - `%=`
 - `<<=`

Some operators are also more verbose than those above:

 - `and`
 - `or`

This list is not exhaustive, especially the compound operators. Pay special attention to the division operators, what implicit type conversion occurs in each case?

## *[Problem - 5 minutes] - Binary Logic*
Distinguish between the `and` and `&` operator and the `or` and `|` operator. Consider the following cases:

 - `5 and 2` vs `5 & 2`
 - `5 or 2` vs `5 | 2`

### 1.2.3 Casting

We can cast between different types using the appropriate functions.

```python
print(int(5.1))
print(float(7))
print(chr(42)) # Have a look at the ascii table for this one - `man ascii`
print(ord('a'))
print(str(5))
print(str(5.0))
print(bin(5))
```

## *[Problem - 5 minutes] - Casting Logic*

 - Demonstrate that `ord` and `chr` are each other's inverse
 - Distinguish between the str and chr casts.
 - Consider the following casts:

 ```python
 int("5.0")
 int("50", 12)
 int("101010110", 2)
 ```
  - The `hex` function also contains an implicit cast, how would you invert the `hex` function?

### 1.2.4 Truth and Falsehood

Python has an interesting relationship with the notions of binary truth. Consider the following comparisons

 - `1 == True`
 - `0 == False`
 - `0.0 == False`
 - `1.0 == True`

 Initially we might consider that 0 is false and 1 is true and that is the end of it, but:

 - `2 == True`
 - `2 == False`
 - `'a' == True`
 - `'a' == False`
 - `'' == True`
 - `'' == False`

We're now posed with an object that is neither true nor false. At this point we adopt a model of "truthyness" and "falseyness", for the purposes of binary logic non-zero integers are considered to be "truthy" and hence will, when forced, evaluate to True, this is also true for non-empty strings. Conversely empty strings and the None type are considered to be "falsey" and will evaluate to false.


## 1.3 Control flow in Python

With our model of programs as a series of instructions in memory accessed by a particular address it follows that we can increment or set this address at will. If we increment by a variable we now have runtime programmatic control over the next sequence of instructions to execute. This is the basis of switches, loops, functions and more generally control flow.

It would be useful for Python to be more than a glorified if somewhat introspective calculator, so we need something to control the program flow. Typically these are switches (if statements) and loops (for and while). Unlike other languages blocks of code within these control statements are de-marked by indentation. Perhaps the biggest hurdle of learning to use Python is inconsistent use of tabs and spaces. To save time and effort, the correct approach according to Python is four spaces for an indent. 

The start of an indented block is also indicated by a colon on the preceding line.


## *[Problem 5 minutes] Cacluating your grade* 

You are required to construct a program that will
compute your current grade given the mark you have received
from your semester.

You are to read the mark from input and your program must output
what grade that mark corresponds to.

Given a mark of 85 or above, your program should output A
Given a mark of 75 or above, your program should output B
Given a mark of 65 or above, your program should output C
Given a mark of 50 or above, your program should output D
Given a mark below 50, your program should output F.



### 1.3.1 Switches
A switch is a common programming language feature where if a certain condition is met then the following code of block is executed. It consists of an `if` statement followed by the condition and the block to execute and then some number of optional `elif` statements with their own conditions before an optional `else` statement with its own block to be executed if none of the other conditions were met. 

```python
if spanish_inquisition is True:
    print("Unexpected")
elif spanish_inquisition is None:  # elif is short for else if
    print("Probably also unexpected")
else:
    print("No spanish inquisition here")
```
At this point it's probably a good idea to introduce some more Python syntax. Unlike most languages, Python tends to use words rather than symbols for its logical operations (as opposed to the binary operations seen earlier). For instance `and` and `or` are keywords:

```python
if True or False:
    print("This will always return True!")

if True and False:
    print("This will never execute!")
```

Equality testing can be done using either the more traditional `==` or the `is` keyword. `is` really compares the addresses of the two objects, and hence: `x is y` is equivalent to `id(x) == id(y)`. Conversely the regular comparison operation compares the values stored at both of those addresses (with some interesting conversions between floating point and integer types).

```python
if 5 == 5:
```
or 
```python
if 5 is 5
```
However
```python
5.0 == 5
True
```
and
```python
5.0 is 5
False
```

There are also the usual greater than and less than comparison operations.
```
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater then or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to

```

Logical statements can also be nested or grouped using brackets

```python
if (x > 5) and (x < 7):
    print("x might be 6")
```

## *[Problem 5 minutes] Multiplicative*   
Write a simple chunk of Python code that determines if a number is a multiple of 13 and a multiple of 3 but not a multiple of 9. 

## 1.4.2 Introduction to Loops

Loops are a construct that repeat some section of code until a condition is fulfilled. If the condition cannot be fulfilled in a timely manner, they will persevere despite your efforts and you will probably need to intervene.

There are two types of loops in Python, the `for` loop and the `while` loop.

The for loop iterates over some collection or range of objects (more on this later) while the while loop simply waits for a condition to be fulfilled.

Try running the following code to get an idea of each of them:

```python
i = 0
while i < 10:
    i = i + 1
    print(i)
```

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

Both of these loops have their uses, try to use one of each in the next problem.

## *[Problem - 10 minutes] - In the Loop*

Getting used to Loops and Switches:

- Write a loop to print each number from 2 to 100
- Modify your previous code to print each even number from 2 to 100
- Modify your previous code to print each prime number from 2 to 100
- (Extension) If you have time left over increase this to primes up to 10000 and `import time` to use the time.time() function to test the speed of your code. If you don't know what this function does, don't forget to use `help()`.
- Again, if you have spare time, try to improve the performance of your code!


## *[Problem - 10 minutes] - Input Sum*

Construct a program that will loop until the user specifies `Q`. In each iteration the program will ask the user
to `input` a number. This number will be added to a running total.

When `Q` is inputted, the program will output the running total and quit.

## 1.3.3 Scope

Unlike many other languages Python scope is at the function level not the block level, as a result the following is legal (but dangerous) Python code:

```python
if x:
  y = 6 # New variable y instantiated
print(y)
```

This code will function correctly if `x` evaluates to `True` but will throw an error regarding `y` being undefined if `x` evaluates to `False`.


### *[Problem - Homework] - No Ifs*
Write a program that takes three integer inputs:

 - If all inputs are equal print their sum
 - If one input differs, print the input that differs
 - If all inputs are different, print their product

You may *not* use the if keyword or any other control flow. The following relations may be helpful:

```python
int(False)
int(not not(x ^ 5))
5 ^ 6 ^ 5
```
